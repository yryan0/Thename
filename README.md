*Introduction*  
Hi everyone! Welcome to our science fair project presentation. Today, we’ll be exploring the effects of nickel plating on metal conductivity after prolonged outdoor exposure. Our research focuses on whether electroplating, which is commonly used to protect materials, can maintain a metal's electrical conductivity in harsh conditions.

**Person 2 (P2):**  
*Problem Statement*  
Our main research question is: **Will nickel plating keep a metal's electrical conductivity after long outdoor exposure to temperature, humidity, acidity, pH levels, and corrosive elements?** Additionally, we want to investigate how the duration of electroplating affects conductivity compared to unplated metal.

**P1:**  
*Hypothesis*  
We hypothesized that the longer an object spends in the electroplating solution, the thicker the nickel plating will become. This thicker plating should provide better corrosion resistance and improve conductivity because both the nickel and the metal underneath are conductive. Even if the nickel wears off over time, we thought that the metal beneath would still maintain conductivity. Furthermore, we anticipated that longer electroplating would decrease the rate of oxidation by creating a protective layer, improving both the corrosion resistance and conductivity of the metal.

*Research Background*  
To give you some context, electroplating is a process where electric current helps metal form a thin coat onto an object. In our experiment, we used nickel as the plating material. The process involves submerging an anode (the nickel) into an acidic solution, such as vinegar and salt, which ionizes the nickel. When the object is dipped into the solution and an electric current is applied, the electrons from the nickel anode are transferred to the object, plating it with a thin layer of nickel.

This technique is commonly used in industries like electronics to increase conductivity and prevent corrosion. You’ve probably seen it in action in jewelry as well, where plating gives the piece a shiny, durable, and long-lasting finish.

**P1:**  

For our experiment, we created three groups of metal samples:  
1. **Control** - A metal sample with no electroplating.  
2. **5-Hour Electroplating** - A metal sample electroplated for 5 hours.  
3. **14-Hour Electroplating** - A metal sample electroplated for 14 hours.

Each sample was exposed to outdoor conditions, including temperature, humidity, acidity, pH levels, and corrosive elements, to test how well the nickel plating could withstand corrosion and maintain conductivity.

**P2:**  
*Results*  
Now, let's talk about what we found. The results were surprising! The **14-hour electroplated sample** lasted 5 days without rusting, while the **5-hour electroplated sample** lasted only 3 days. However, the **control sample**—which wasn’t plated at all—never rusted and remained conductive, reaching a voltage of 1.47V.

As for the plated samples, the **14-hour sample** started to rust in an arch shape, while the **5-hour sample** rusted in a shape resembling a fingernail. Interestingly, soil began sticking to the rust patches, which caused them to erode even faster. The **control sample** remained nearly unchanged, though it did develop some cloudy grey patches.

**P1:**  
*Discussion of Results*  
These results were quite interesting! The 14-hour electroplated sample showed signs of rust, but it remained conductive, which was an unexpected outcome. The control sample, which had no electroplating at all, also maintained its conductivity and didn’t rust, suggesting that nickel plating isn’t the only factor affecting corrosion resistance.

The 5-hour electroplated sample had a quicker rate of rusting, and the corrosion spread more rapidly, which makes sense because the thinner plating wasn’t as effective at protecting the metal underneath.

**P2:**  
*Conclusion*  
In conclusion, our hypothesis was partially correct. The longer the metal spends in the electroplating solution, the thicker the plating becomes, and the more corrosion-resistant it appears. However, it didn’t entirely prevent rusting or guarantee better conductivity than the control sample. The control, which wasn't plated at all, still performed well.

Overall, this experiment suggests that electroplating, while effective under the right conditions, may not always be the best solution for corrosion resistance. Understanding electroplating and its effects on materials is important for advancing corrosion resistance and improving material engineering.
